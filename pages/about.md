Welcome to typetune!

## My Story

I'm Laura, a Media, Journalism & Publishing student, living in Oxford. As part of my Typographic Design module I've created 'typetune', a blog exploring the use of typography in the music industry. 

Music has permeated through my life. Even now, music is accompanying my thoughts as I type. As a child I would sit with my Dad, flipping through dusty boxes containing his record collection. The assortment of colours, fonts and imagery which adorned the album covers seemed to bring the music to life, each defining the sound of the record. 

Each era brings with it new imagery and text, seemingly telling a story and forming an image which not only fits the sound but becomes imprinted on society.  

## The Logo

The 'typetune' logo consists of a 'T' cocooned by two music notes. This effect gives the impression of an outline. 



Colour 

red and black, edgy colour scheme, linking to many of the genres of music discussed in the blog.

Paying homage to many band logos which utilise a similar colour palette 

Legabilility 

low contrast, allowing the logo to be easily legible 

high weight, making the logo appear strong
