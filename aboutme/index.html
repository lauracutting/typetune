	<h1><span class="highlight">Who am I?</span></h1>

	<p>I'm Laura Cutting, the founder of 'Typetune'. I'm currently living and studying in Oxford however I was raised in London, a city renowned for it's music scene.</p>

	<p>Growing up, rather than partaking in sports like many of my friends I was usually found tucked into a quiet corner reading or listening to music, the impacts of both of these passions are ever present in my life today ...</p>

<h1><span class="highlight">Why do I love music so much?</span></h1>

	<p>I've been surrounded by music my whole life. From a young age I was presented with a myriad of styles and sounds from the psychedelic twangs of the <a class="fact_link" href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/revolver/1441164670" target="blank">Beatles' 'Revolver' album</a> to Elton John's uptempo <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75r0nQu-hMs" target="blank">'Crocodile Rock'</a>.</P>

	<p>As soon as I was old enough to attend gigs with my friends I would scrape together enough money for a ticket and queue outside, often battling through icy autumn rain, brimming with excitement and anticipation.</p>

	<p>Here's a picture I took at a 'The 1975' gig last year:

	<p>I now look forward to live music returning in the (hopefully) not too distant future. </p>
