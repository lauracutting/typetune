Influenced by the use of psychedellic drugs. The word psychedelic derives from the latin phrase 'psyche' meaning mind, and the greek term 'delos', which means to manifest, or awaken: 'to awaken the mind'. The free flowing shapes and potent colours which infuse 60s and 70s art reflect the freedom expressed in the period. 

Music festivals and concerts were a prominent feature of the 60s landscape. Musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones emerced themselves in the psychedelic drug culture, which is reflected in promotional posters and album covers.

*1967 was the peak year for psychedelic rock. It gave us Sgt. Pepper’s, debut albums by Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, the Grateful Dead, and the Monterey Pop Festival. It was also The Summer of Love, the counter-cultural phenomenon where nearly 100,000 young people arrived in San Francisco’s Haight Ashbury district to celebrate music, art, and life. It was the year where just about everyone tried to make a psychedelic rock record, from obscure underground bands to bubblegum pop groups. Even Sonny Bono!*

Jimi Hendrix

* The cover art for Hendrix’s second album, *Axis: Bold as Love* (1967) features the Hindu image of the Supreme God Vishnu

  * The counter-culture movement of the 60s was highly influenced by Eastern culture for its spiritual aspect that condoned self-discovery and aesthetic values. This rejection of the establishment and subsequent self-discovery meant freeing one’s body and mind from the constructs of society, through the use of drugs or trance-inducing music. Hendrix himself partook in such mind-freeing practices by taking tabs of LSD before shows to be connected subconsciously with his music, creating an image for himself as a “hippy.”
  * bright pink, blues, greens, browns, and yellow but uses accented gold to highlight the psychedelic theme the musician aimed for. This replacement of religious symbols or gods with an image of the artist undermines the religious significance of the original image; it was also a strategy used in various album covers of the 1960s and 70s

  Wes Wilson 
*  Designer whose posters came to define the 1960s psychedellic rock movement.   
* His influences include the Art Nouveau movement, Victorian and Edwardian typography as well as the French poster design of the late 1800s. These formed the style which became Wes Wilson's trademark. 
* His work often involved wrapping words around fixed, free-flowing areas in order to fill up space. Fluid block lettering style that became synonymous with the '60s
* He created iconic posters for artists such as Jefferson Airplane, Otis Reading, and the Grateful Dead

  * Example: In this poster for an Otis Rush concert
