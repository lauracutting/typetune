Much of the 60s and 70s music scene was influenced by the use of psychedellic drugs. The word psychedelic derives from the latin phrase 'psyche' meaning mind, and the greek term 'delos', which means to manifest, or awaken: 'to awaken the mind'. The free flowing shapes and potent colours which infuse 60s and 70s poster and album art reflect the freedom expressed in the period. 

Heavily weighted fonts, intended to be noticed,  ideal for drawing in crowds for the concerts they often promoted. 

Jimi Hendrix

* The cover art for Hendrix’s second album, *Axis: Bold as Love* (1967) features the Hindu image of the Supreme God Vishnu

  * The counter-culture movement of the 60s was highly influenced by Eastern culture for its spiritual aspect that condoned self-discovery and aesthetic values. This rejection of the establishment and subsequent self-discovery meant freeing one’s body and mind from the constructs of society, through the use of drugs or trance-inducing music. Hendrix himself partook in such mind-freeing practices by taking tabs of LSD before shows to be connected subconsciously with his music, creating an image for himself as a “hippy.”
  * bright pink, blues, greens, browns, and yellow but uses accented gold to highlight the psychedelic theme the musician aimed for. This replacement of religious symbols or gods with an image of the artist undermines the religious significance of the original image; it was also a strategy used in various album covers of the 1960s and 70s





Much balloon like lettering was used, perhaps a symbol of hope during these socially tense times. This is heavily featured in the work of psychedelic artist Wes Wilson. Wilson's poster designs came to define the 1960s psychedelic rock movement.   

* His influences include the Art Nouveau movement, Victorian and Edwardian typography as well as the French poster design of the late 1800s. These formed the style which became Wes Wilson's trademark. 
* His work often involved wrapping words around fixed, free-flowing areas in order to fill up space. Fluid block lettering style that became synonymous with the '60s
* He created iconic posters for artists such as Jefferson Airplane, Otis Reading, and the Grateful Dead

  * Example: In this poster for an Otis Rush concert almost every available space is occupied by free moving Art Nouveau inspired lines, bold colours and lettering influenced by 19th century graphic designer Alfred Roller. 

    Initially the poster was rejected due to its barely legible lettering to which Wilson reponded, "They'll stop to read it because they can't read it." The free flowing typography used in Wilson, and other psychodellic designers', posters does not distract from the appeal of the works as the overall design as the words are ofted morphed and arranged to form a larger image, demonstrated in the Otis Rush poster. In addition, vivid colours animate the iamgery and typography, making the posters marketable.

* However, some of Wilson's posters utilise more legible fonts. In his poster for the Byrds' first concert, Wilson has utilised a more structured design.

  * This style of typography, although adapted in the 60s, found its roots in the 1890s. It's timelessly modern feel once more only proves the lasting power and impact of this type of advertising.
