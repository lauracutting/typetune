Influenced by the use of psychedellic drugs. The word psychedelic derives from the latin word 'psyche' meaning mind, and the greek word 'delos', which means to manifest, or awaken: 'to awaken the mind'. The free flowing shapes and potent colours used in 60s and 70s art reflect this phrase. 

Music festivals and concerts were a prominent feature of the 60s landscape, and musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones emerced themselves in the psychedelic moulding the unique artform found expression in band posters and album covers.
