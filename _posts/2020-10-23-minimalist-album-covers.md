Album covers are designed to entice the viewer, ordinarily utilising bold colour schemes and pertinent artwork or by spotlighting the music artist, however some have taken a leap away from the ordinary. Stripping back the paint, those daring enough have allowed their music to speak for itself, relying purely on block colours and spartan typefaces to sell their records.
