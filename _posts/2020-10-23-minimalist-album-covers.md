 'Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away'- Antoine de Saint-Exupery 

Album covers are designed to entice the viewer, ordinarily utilising bold colour schemes and pertinent artwork or by spotlighting the music artist, however some have taken a leap away from the ordinary. Stripping back the paint, those daring enough have allowed their music to speak for itself, relying purely on block colours and spartan typefaces to sell their records.

Leaving more space on an album cover causes a ‘curiosity gap’, encouraging the viewer to use their imagination form their own story. Less clutter cuts away from the unnecessary, narrowing the viewer's focus and emphasizing the bare essentials of the album cover. When done successfully, this strengthens the artist's message.
