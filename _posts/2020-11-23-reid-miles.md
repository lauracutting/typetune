* Miles designed more than 500 covers for Blue Note Records
* jazz
* Designer Viljami Salminen wrote in a blog post that *“During the Fifties, when the design industry was in flux, Reid Miles pushed forward the way the typography is treated with his bold, playful designs, creative use of typefaces, and his distinct preference for contrast and asymmetry.''*
* modernist
* Using typoraphy as a visual element:  *treating the typography as visual elements that can be broken apart, stacked upon one another in a playful way, blown up or shrunk down and brought together with the photography in a way that seems gravitational. The layouts are often evasively perfect as they look as if to lay any of them out even slightly differently would be to lay them out wrong.*
