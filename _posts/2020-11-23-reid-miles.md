* Miles designed more than 500 covers for Blue Note Records
* jazz
* During the Fifties, when the design industry was in flux, Reid Miles highlighted the importance of typography with his bold lines and playful designs. He had a distinct preference for contrast and asymmetry which reflected the distinction between the black and white keys of a piano - an essential instrument in the Jazz music which Miles promoted.
* modernist
* Rather than using typography for its primary purpose, to accompany an image, Miles formed it into a visual element: Â *treating the typography as visual elements that can be broken apart, stacked upon one another in a playful way, blown up or shrunk down and brought together with the photography in a way that seems gravitational. The layouts are often evasively perfect as they look as if to lay any of them out even slightly differently would be to lay them out wrong.*
