Now, album covers are beginning to hold less significance. Rather than occupying a 12 inch by 12 inch vinyl sleeve, which could be pulled from a shelf and admired in all its glory, album covers are increasingly becoming small icons on screens which are scrolled past in seconds, their aim not to be admired like before but instead to quickly grab the attention of the listener.

Importance of branding in modern age albums, linking elements eg: imagery, colour scheme and typography on the album cover to promotional posters, music videos ect. 

The album is now not the only branding tool, as it had been in say the 60s. In previous eras it was - in most cases - the first glimpse of what a band's next step looked like.  However streaming services have ushered in a new reality; music no longer depends on the full cohesive album the way the eras of vinyl, CDs and cassettes did. These days, it's not always the album cover announcing the branding for an artist's album.

As opposed to detailed imagery and fanciful typography, the best modern covers feature clean and simple graphics hold up well in the digital world. An example of a digital friendly cover is Drake's *If You're Reading This, It's Too Late* (2015).

*Hand-lettered on a stark white background, it holds up well on 2 inch squares and T-shirts alike..*

*Drake's album also worked because it evoked an instant response from viewers. The cover [immediately became a meme](http://fusion.net/list/50583/15-of-the-best-drake-if-youre-reading-this-album-cover-parodies/) — people used it as a template for jokes, helping to promote the album through their mimicry. That's a great design — one that can be copied endlessly without distorting the original.*

More of an emphasis has been placed on engaging the fans in album cover design. An increase in fan made style cover artwork. 

Digital typefaces popularized in the 90s -

*Almost every font from album covers in this decade makes use of a geometric-inspired typeface, reminiscent of computer code or bitmap video games. (And for a good reason: 1996 marked the boom in instant messaging and gaming consoles like Nintendo 64 and Sony PlayStation)*
