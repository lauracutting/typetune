Radiohead's in

Step away from the paranoia of *OK Computer* and *Hail to the Thief* and the intense rock feel of Radiohead's previous albums.

More organic music - Donwood’s artwork became more colourful and organic 

Cover is comprised of wax splats 



syringes from a friend of mine who’s a doctor with the aim of emptying the contents of paintballs, refilling them with black ink, and firing them from a paintball gun. That idea (along with many!) didn’t work, but it did mean that I had a load of syringes with hypodermic needles and lots of ink.
