MTV was introduced as a 24/7 music video channel in 1981, a time when the visualization of music was still an emerging concept. The channelâ€™s bold logo and the spotlighting of artists saw a shift in music production, providing a fresh, youthful perspective and catalysing the dominance of the music video in pop culture.



To complete the logo, 'TV' has been scrawled across the 'M' in a fast paced graffiti style font.
